        Managed via <a target="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. Pay for this for a couple years and then let it die. People can figure out I'm gone in that time period.

        <h4>My domains</h4>
        You can stop paying for <i>teamfossil.xyz</i>, but I'd like the following kept under ownership for 5 years following my death.
